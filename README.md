# CloudFlare hook for `dehydrated`

This is a hook for the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) ACME client [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) that allows you to use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) DNS records to respond to `dns-01` challenges. This script requires Python and as well as your CloudFlare account e-mail and API key (as environment variables).

## WSL, Ubuntu, and potentially Debian prerequisites
You may need to install the following two packages in addition to Python 3 if you run into issues during the Installation:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip python-is-python3
```


## Installation and usage without a Python virtual environment

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated
$ cd dehydrated
$ mkdir hooks
$ git clone https://github.com/SeattleDevs/letsencrypt-cloudflare-hook hooks/cloudflare
```

Using Python 3:
```
$ pip3 install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements.txt
```


### Configuration

An API token from your CloudFlare account is expected to be in the environment, so make sure to:

```
$ export CF_API_TOKEN='ABLQcziApPVRAEjXpa9bzXcHySpzja24zcTOzkV7'
```

API tokens need the `Zone.Zone` and `Zone.DNS` permissions. You can restrict them by source IP and for specific zones.

You can supply multiple API tokens credentials by separating them with one or more spaces.  Tokens will be tried in the order given, until one is found that serves the relevant domain.
Leading, trailing, and extra spaces are ignored.

```
$ export CF_API_TOKEN='ABLQcziApPVRAEjXpa9bzXcHySpzja24zcTOzkV7 GingohChi0eithaigaushiuHudaef3ag6eef1cah'
```

Optionally, you can specify the DNS servers to be used for propagation checking via the `CF_DNS_SERVERS` environment variable (props [bennettp123](https://github.com/bennettp123)):

```
$ export CF_DNS_SERVERS='8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4'
```

If you experience problems with DNS propagation, increasing the time (in seconds) this hook waits for things to settle down after setting the DNS records, may help. The default is 10.

```
$ export CF_SETTLE_TIME='30'
```

If you want more information about what is going on while the hook is running:

```
$ export CF_DEBUG='true'
```

Alternatively, these statements can be placed in `dehydrated/config`, which is automatically sourced by `dehydrated` on startup:

```
echo "export CF_API_TOKEN=ABLQcziApPVRAEjXpa9bzXcHySpzja24zcTOzkV7" >> config
echo "export CF_DEBUG=true" >> config
```


### Usage

```
$ ./dehydrated -c -d example.com -t dns-01 -k 'hooks/cloudflare/hook.py'

## Installation with Python virtual envs and bash script for quick re-runs
The following will install dehydrated in `cert_workspace` folder under your home path.  The last line sets up a Python virtual env named dehydrated_env.

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir cert_workspace
$ cd cert_workspace
$ git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated
$ cd dehydrated
$ mkdir hooks
$ git clone https://github.com/SeattleDevs/letsencrypt-cloudflare-hook hooks/cloudflare
$ python3 -m venv dehydrated_env
```

### Initialize the python environment
Activate the virtual env and install dependencies:

```
source dehydrated_env/bin/activate 
$ (dehydrated_env) pip3 install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements.txt
```

### Usage with a bash script
You can take a shortcut by creating a bash script (such as `domaincert.sh` in `~/cert_workspace`) as following to generate your certificate quickly since you need to regenerate your certificates once every 90 days. Replace `CF_API_TOKEN` (your Cloudflare API token), and `DOMAIN` variables with your own info. The following assumes that the bash script is stored where you created the git clone folder for dehydrated to reduce the chances of accidentally checking in the bash script into a git repo because it is a good security practice not to store credentials in git repos.

```
#!/bin/bash

export CF_API_TOKEN='ABLQcziApPVRAEjXpa9bzXcHySpzja24zcTOzkV7'
export DOMAIN='my.domain.com'

export CF_DNS_SERVERS='8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4'
# export CF_DEBUG='true'

dehydrated/dehydrated -c -d $DOMAIN  -t dns-01 -k 'dehydrated/hooks/cloudflare/hook.py'

cp dehydrated/certs/$DOMAIN/privkey.pem $DOMAIN.letsencrypt.key
cp dehydrated/certs/$DOMAIN/fullchain.pem $DOMAIN.letsencrypt.crt

exit 0
```

Assuming that you created a bash script as `~/cert_workspace/domaincert.sh` , you can run it with the following. Note that the first time you run dehydrated, it may prompt you to accept its terms.  Please read and follow with any such instructions that it may provide, and then re-run your `domaincert.sh` script to generate the certificate.

```
$ (dehydrated_env) cd ~/cert_workspace
$ (dehydrated_env) ./domaincert.sh
```


### Re-run (every 90 days or 8x days)
This is what you need to re-run before the 90 day expiration of your certificate to generate a new certificate assuming that you set up your installation as above.

```
$ cd ~/cert_workspace/dehydrated
$ source dehydrated_env/bin/activate
$ (dehydrated_env) cd ~/cert_workspace
$ (dehydrated_env) ./domaincert.sh
```

### Update and Re-run
If you want to update the scripts to the latest version (i.e. because Python, Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare changed their APIs causing errors when you re-run the script, or if there is a security update), run the following:

```
$ cd ~/cert_workspace/dehydrated
$ git pull
$ cd hooks/cloudflare
$ git pull
$ source dehydrated_env/bin/activate
$ (dehydrated_env) pip3 install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements.txt
```

and then re-generate your certifcate as before:

```
$ (dehydrated_env) cd ~/cert_workspace
$ (dehydrated_env) ./domaincert.sh
```


## Testing (unit test)
If you are making changes to the code, run the unit tests with `tox` to make sure your changes aren't breaking the hook.

```
$ (dehydrated_env) cd hooks/cloudflare
$ (dehydrated_env) pip install tox
$ (dehydrated_env) tox
```
